## Description of the System

A To-Do list Application is a digital tool design to help users organize and manage tasks or activities they need to complete, It typically allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks, set deadlines, prioritize items, and categorize them into different lists or projects.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
